# Post-Hurricane-Structure-Damage-Assessment
We plan to deploy three models: CNN, MobileNet, and ResNet-50, with a focus on using transfer learning techniques. These techniques enable the models to leverage large pre-trained datasets, facilitating a more generalized and efficient learning process that is well-suited to categorizing satellite imagery where data may be less detailed.

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning system to classify hurricane-damaged buildings from satellite images. By combining CNN architectures with domain-specific image processing techniques, our system enables rapid post-disaster damage assessments.

## 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- Accessed datasets using Python libraries like NumPy and PIL.
- Resized all images to `128x128` pixels for uniformity.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed visual inspection and class distribution analysis.
- Assessed image quality to detect potential classification challenges.

## 3. Feature Engineering
- Scaled pixel values to `[0, 1]`.
- Applied edge detection (Sobel, Canny) and texture analysis (GLCM).
- Implemented PCA for dimensionality reduction and watershed segmentation.

## 4. Data Augmentation
- Used PyTorch to apply:
  - Rotation
  - Zooming
  - Horizontal flipping  
This enriched the dataset for better model generalization.

## 5. Data Preparation
- **Training:** `train_another` ‚Äî 5,000 images/class  
- **Validation:** `validation_another` ‚Äî 1,000 images/class  
- **Test (Unbalanced):** 8,000 damaged | 1,000 undamaged  
- **Test (Balanced):** 1,000 per class  
- Batched using `PyTorch DataLoader`.

## 6. Model Selection and Training
- Fine-tuned CNN architectures to handle `128x128` inputs.
- Leveraged **MobileNet** and **ResNet-50** with transfer learning.
- Integrated decaying learning rate schedules to improve convergence.

## 7. Evaluation and Iteration
- Metrics used: `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, `F1-score`.
- Continuous refinement of models and preprocessing pipelines.

## 8. Web Application Development for Deployment
- **Backend:** Flask for Python model integration.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JS (with potential React/Angular).
- **UI:** Dashboard for image upload, prediction results, and damage maps.

## 9. Cloud Deployment and Management
- **Platform:** AWS (EC2, S3, Elastic Beanstalk).
- **Focus:** Scalability and high availability during disaster response.

## üöÄ Future Work
- Add support for multi-class damage levels.
- Integrate GIS for geo-tagged predictions.
- Expand to include fire, flood, or earthquake scenarios.
