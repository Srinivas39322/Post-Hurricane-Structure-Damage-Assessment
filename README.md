We plan to deploy three models: CNN, MobileNet, and ResNet-50, with a focus on using transfer learning techniques. These techniques enable the models to leverage large pre-trained datasets, facilitating a more generalized and efficient learning process that is well-suited to categorizing satellite imagery where data may be less detailed.
